# Cursor Project Rules for vibeycats

## Required Workflow Pattern

**IMPORTANT: Always follow this workflow pattern for EVERY instruction/request:**

1. **STEP 1 - Explain**: First, explain what the user has asked for in your own words. Clarify understanding of the request.

2. **STEP 2 - Describe Solution**: Describe your proposed solution approach. Include:
   - What files will be modified
   - What changes will be made
   - Any considerations or alternatives
   - Potential impacts or side effects

3. **STEP 3 - Ask for Confirmation**: Ask the user how they want to proceed before writing any code. Wait for their approval/confirmation.

4. **STEP 4 - Implement**: Only after receiving confirmation, proceed to write code and make changes.

## Workflow Exception

- **ONLY** skip this pattern if the user explicitly says "just do it", "implement now", or similar explicit permission to proceed immediately.

## Code Style & Best Practices

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Maintain existing code structure and patterns
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components modular and maintainable
- Test changes work with existing game logic

## Project Context
